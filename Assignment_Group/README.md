## Project Objective
In this project, you are required to use AI model to predict a credit risk problem.
Your data source can be from Kaggle

The major risks faced by banks include credit, operational, market, and liquidity risk. As for UBS, credit risk is one of the primary risks (please see below the extract from the annual report). Credit risk is the risk of an economic loss from the failure of a counterparty to fulfil its contractual obligations. Its effect is measured by the cost of replacing cash flows if the other party defaults. Financial instrument like Credit Default Swap (CDS) is to hedge credit risk, but CDS is quite expensive. Hence, prediction of credit risk becoming important in order to decide if the financial institute should purchase CDS.  Credit risk analysis is to quantify the level of credit risk that the borrower presents to the lender. It involves assigning measurable numbers to the estimated probability of default of the borrower.
